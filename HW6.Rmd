# Assignmnet 6: Risk Management

**Initial Set up 
```{r cars}
set.seed(903776309)

# Generating a random number in the interval (1980, 2001)
random_number <- runif(1, min = 1980, max = 2001)

# Printing the seed and random number
cat("Seed: 903776309\nRandom Number:", random_number)

start_year <- random_number
end_year <- random_number + 10

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
